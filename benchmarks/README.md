# Benchmarks

Benchmarks are executable evidence, not decorative numbers. Run them from the
repository root with the environment being reported.

## Meta-PGS rules

`meta_rules.py` reproduces the same-trait comparison in the algorithm notes
over 30 independent seeds:

```bash
python benchmarks/meta_rules.py
```

It writes every replicate, a mean/standard-deviation table, and machine-readable
provenance under `benchmarks/results/`. The simulation parameter
`shared_error_correlation` correlates score errors as a stylized consequence of
shared discovery information. It is deliberately not called sample overlap:
the simulator does not model overlapping people or discovery GWAS estimation.

The committed results are a regression reference, not a claim about real
cohorts. Re-run before changing a default or making a performance claim.

## Stack scaling

`stack_scaling.py` runs each Gaussian case in a fresh process, warms the
numerical kernels, and records wall time plus absolute peak resident memory:

```bash
python benchmarks/stack_scaling.py
```

The small defaults are suitable for routine validation. Supply representative
cohort dimensions explicitly before making a deployment claim, for example
`--cases 20000x250 50000x500`. Peak RSS includes the Python/NumPy/Numba runtime;
compare rows produced by the same command and environment.
